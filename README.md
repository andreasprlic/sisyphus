With the increasing amount of structural data, the number of homologous protein structures bearing topological irregularities is steadily growing. These include proteins with _circular permutations_, _segment-swapping_, context-dependent folding or _chameleon sequences_ that can adopt alternative secondary structures. Most of these non-trivial protein relationships are readily identified during the systematic analysis in the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database. However, their automatic identification using the existing computational tools still remains difficult or impossible. Such non-trivial cases of protein relationships are known to pose a problem to the multiple alignment algorithms and to impede the comparative modeling studies. They support a new emerging concept of evolutionary changeable protein fold and thus create practical difficulties to the hierarchical protein structural classifications.

 To facilitate the understanding and to provide a comprehensive
annotation of proteins with such non-trivial structural relationships
we have created <strong>SISYPHUS</strong>, a compendium to the SCOP database.

 The <strong>SISYPHUS</strong> database contains a collection of manually curated
structural alignments and their interrelationships. Each multiple
alignment within the <strong>SISYPHUS</strong> database consists of structurally
similar regions common to a group of proteins. These regions range
from oligomeric biological units, or individual domains to fragments
of different size representing either internal structural repeats or
motifs common to structurally distinct proteins. The SISYPHUS multiple
alignments are displayed with SPICE, a browser that provides an
integrated view of protein sequences, structures and their annotations.

Note:
This dataset is from before the PDB remediation efforts, as such there may be
some entries with inconsistent chain IDs.
